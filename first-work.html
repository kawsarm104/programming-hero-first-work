        Bangladesh (/bæŋləˈdɛʃ/;[15] Bengali: বাংলাদেশ, pronounced [ˈbaŋlaˌdeʃ]
        (About this soundlisten)), officially the People's Republic of
        Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous
        country in the world, with a population exceeding 163 million people, in
        an area of 147,570 square kilometres (56,980 sq mi), making it one of
        the most densely populated countries in the world. Bangladesh shares
        land borders with India to the west, north, and east, Myanmar to the
        southeast, and the Bay of Bengal to the south. It is narrowly separated
        from Nepal and Bhutan by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the
        Indian state of Sikkim in the north, respectively. Dhaka, the capital
        and largest city, is the nation's economic, political, and cultural hub.
        Chittagong, the largest seaport is the second-largest city.

        Bangladesh forms the larger and eastern part of the Bengal region.[16]
        According to the ancient Indian texts, Rāmāyana and Mahābhārata, the
        Vanga Kingdom, one of the namesakes of the Bengal region, was a strong
        naval power. In the ancient and classical periods of the Indian
        subcontinent, the territory was home to many principalities, including
        the Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela. It was also a
        Mauryan province under the reign of Ashoka. The principalities were
        notable for their overseas trade, contacts with the Roman world, the
        export of fine muslin and silk to the Middle East, and spreading of
        philosophy and art to Southeast Asia. The Gupta Empire, Pala Empire, the
        Chandra dynasty, and the Sena dynasty were the last pre-Islamic Bengali
        middle kingdoms. Islam was introduced during the Pala Empire, through
        trade with the Abbāsid Caliphate,[17] but following the Ghurid conquests
        led by Bakhtiyār Khaljī, the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and
        preaching of Shah Jalāl in the north-east, it spread across the entire
        region. In 1576, the wealthy Bengal Sultanate was absorbed into the
        Mughal Empire, but its rule was briefly interrupted by the Sūr Empire.
        Mughal Bengal, worth 12% of world GDP (late 17th century), waved the
        Proto-industrialization, showed signs of a possible industrial
        revolution,[18][19] established relations with the Dutch and English
        East India Company, and became also the basis of the Anglo-Mughal War.
        Following the death of Emperor Aurangzēb Ālamgir and Governor Shāista
        Khān in the early 1700s, the region became a semi-independent state
        under the Nawabs of Bengal. Sirāj ud-Daulah, the last Nawab of Bengal,
        was defeated by the British East India Company at the Battle of Plassey
        in 1757 and the whole region fell under Company rule by 1793.[20]
      </p>
      <p>
        After the decline of the British Bengal Presidency, the borders of
        modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal in
        August 1947 at the time of partition of India, when the region became
        East Pakistan as a part of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan.[21]
        Later the rise of a pro-democracy movement thrived on Bengali
        nationalism and self-determination, leading to the Liberation War and
        eventually resulted in the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign and
        independent nation in 1971.

      />
      <p>
        Spilling out into the Bay of Bengal is Cox’s Bazar, an area covered in
        salty fishing skiffs and bustling jetties. This little town in the far
        south-east of Bangladesh is known for its stunning beach which stretches
        for an amazing 120 kilometers from north to south along the side of the
        balmy Indian Ocean. This is the third longest beach on the planet and
        you will find local fishermen reeling in the day’s catch as well as
        bubbling rock pools and crashing turquoise waves that make this a great
        spot for surfing.
      </p>
      <h2>2. The Sundarbans</h2>

      />
      <p>
        The Sundarbans are located at the point where the mighty waterways of
        the Brahmaputra and the scared Ganges crash into each other at the edge
        of the Bay of Bengal. As you would expect, the area is also covered in
        spectacular wildlife and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here you will
        find Bengal tigers stalking the mangroves as well as rhesus macaques
        swinging in the canopies. Other highlights include chitals and you will
        also find local huts dotted around the area and hiding beneath waxy palm
        trees.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Dhaka</h2>

      <p>
        It may seem a world away from the wilds of area like the Sundarbans
        mangroves but the city of Dhaka offers you a jungle of a different kind.
        Sprawling along the Buriganga River, Dhaka used to be the home of the
        British Raj during the colonial period as well as Mughal princes and the
        likes of Shah Jahan (the architect of the iconic Taj Mahal). Nowadays
        more than 17 million people call this city home and you can expect
        temples, churches, mosques monuments, and colorful and aromatic bazaars.
        Make sure to also check out the curry and golap eateries of Old Dhaka
        while you are here.
